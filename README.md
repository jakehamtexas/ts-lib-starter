# ts-lib-starter

This is a template repository that can be used for starting your own typescript library project. It's extensible enough that you should be able to configure it to your liking. It's especially configured for server applications, server libraries, or client libraries with minimal tweaking. It would also be handly for client applications with a little bit more tweaking. Here are some of the features:

### CI and publish Github Action workflows already configured.
  #### CI steps include:
    - Build (tsc)
    - Test (Mocha + Chai)
    - Lint (ESLint)
### Scripts enabled for maximum convenience:
    - Build/Rebuild
    - Watch (Nodemon)
    - Lint (ESLint)
    - Tests (Mocha + Chai)
    - Format (Prettier)
### Husky and lint-staged for immediate resolution of commit issues.


Enjoy!
